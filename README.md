# EEE460_ScreenSafety
Everyday electronic devices are filled with screens that can harm our eyes. 
A special spectrometer is constructed to evaluate the viewing safety and optical efficiency of screens by analysing the emission spectrum at various wavelengths.
The program compares time-averaged relative intensity of short-wavelength light to a threshold value to assess viewing safety.
